# Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) Implementation

This repository contains the implementation of a **Wasserstein GAN (WGAN)** for the Kaggle competition *I'm Something of a Painter Myself*. The model leverages advanced generative techniques to produce high-quality Monet-style images.

## Introduction
WGAN is a variation of GANs designed to improve training stability and generate realistic images. This implementation focuses on generating Monet-style paintings as part of the Kaggle competition.

## Competition Overview
The Kaggle competition *I'm Something of a Painter Myself* challenges participants to:
- Generate 7,000â€“10,000 Monet-style images.
- Evaluate image quality using the **MiFID** metric, which combines FID and memorization distance.

## Acknowledgments
- The Kaggle competition organizers for this creative challenge.
- The authors of WGAN for introducing the Wasserstein distance in GAN training.
- Kaggle for providing the platform and community.
